### Branching Strategy 

Below is a branching strategy to manage your project effectively. It includes **Main (Production)**, **Stage**, **UAT**, **Feature**, **Bugfix**, **Hotfix**, **Tester**, and **Development (Dev)** branches.

---

### **1. Branch Definitions**
1. **`main` (Production):**
   - Represents the latest stable release of your application.
   - Deployed to production.
   - Protected branch: only pull requests (PRs) reviewed and approved can be merged.

2. **`stage`:**
   - Pre-production environment.
   - Used for integration testing and final validation before deploying to `main`.
   - Updated via PRs from `feature_*`, `bugfix_*`, and `hotfix` branches.

3. **`uat`:**
   - Used for client-side testing (User Acceptance Testing).
   - Ensures the application works as expected under the clientâ€™s requirements.
   - Updated via PRs from `stage`.

4. **`feature_*`:**
   - Used for developing new features.
   - One branch per feature (e.g., `feature_login`, `feature_payment`).
   - Created from `dev` and merged back into `dev` or `stage` when completed.

5. **`bugfix_*`:**
   - Used for fixing bugs identified during development or testing.
   - One branch per bugfix (e.g., `bugfix_issue123`).
   - Created from `dev` or `stage` and merged back into `dev` or `stage`.

6. **`hotfix`:**
   - Used for critical fixes to production (e.g., security patches, urgent fixes).
   - Created from `main` and merged directly back into `main` and `stage`.

7. **`tester`:**
   - Dedicated branch for QA or testers to validate features, bugs, or releases.
   - Updated with changes from `dev`, `feature_*`, or `bugfix_*`.

8. **`dev`:**
   - Main development branch.
   - Contains the latest ongoing development.
   - Features and bugfixes are merged here before moving to `stage`.
