Q. Differece between branching and merging stratergy?
ANS:

1. Branching Strategy:  
   - Definition: A branching strategy defines how branches are structured and managed within a version control system to facilitate collaboration and workflow organization.
   - Purpose: Helps teams organize work, isolate features, bug fixes, or experiments, and manage parallel development efficiently.
   - Examples: 
     - Git Flow: Separates branches like `develop`, `feature`, `release`, and `hotfix`.
     - GitHub Flow: Uses a single `main` branch with feature branches.
     - Trunk-Based Development: Directly commits to the `main` branch with short-lived branches.
   - Focus: Primarily on planning how the development process is divided into branches.  

2. Merging Strategy:  
   - Definition: A merging strategy defines how changes from different branches are combined into a single branch in a version control system.
   - Purpose: Ensures smooth integration of code from different branches while minimizing conflicts.
   - Types:  
     - Fast-forward Merge: Incorporates changes without creating an additional commit when there’s a linear history.
     - Three-way Merge: Creates a merge commit when there’s a non-linear history.
     - Rebase: Reapplies commits on top of another branch for a cleaner history.
     - Squash Merge: Combines all changes from a branch into a single commit.
   - Focus: Deals with how changes are integrated back into the main or target branch.



Q. How can you delete a branch in Git?
ANS:

Use git branch -d <branch-name> to delete a local branch. Use git push origin-delete <branch-name> to delete a branch from a remote repository.



Q. difference between merge and rebase?
ANS:
'git merge' combines changes from two branches, preserving their history, while 'git rebase' move or combines a sequence of commite, providing a cleanere history.


how to change user and group permission?
ANS:
  1. Changing UID (User ID)
    To change the UID, use the usermod command.

    Command Syntax:

    Example:
      sudo usermod -u 2001 demo
    This changes the UID of the user demo to 2001.

 2. Changing GID (Group ID)
  To change the GID, use the groupmod command.

  Command Syntax:
    sudo groupmod -g <new_gid> <groupname>

  Example:
    sudo groupmod -g 3001 demo_group
  This changes the GID of the group demo_group to 3001.
