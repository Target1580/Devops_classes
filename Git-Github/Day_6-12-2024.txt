 List of Git and Linux Commands with Usage:

1. ls -la
   - Usage: Lists all files (including hidden files) and directories in the current directory, along with their permissions, sizes, and modification dates.
   
2. git status
   - Usage: Shows the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

3. git stash
   - Usage: Saves the changes in your working directory that you’re not ready to commit. It allows you to revert to a clean working directory without losing your progress.

4. git stash list
   - Usage: Lists all stashes you’ve saved. Each stash is identified with an index (stash@{0}, stash@{1}, etc.).

5. git stash pop stash@{}
   - Usage: Restores the changes from a stash back into the working directory. It removes the stash from the list after applying it.

6. git add .
   - Usage: Stages all modified and new files in the current directory and its subdirectories for the next commit.

7. git commit -m "message"
   - Usage: Commits the staged changes with a brief message describing what the commit does.

8. git commit -am "message"
   - Usage: Stages and commits all tracked files with a given message. It’s useful for committing changes to files that Git already tracks.

9. git commit --amend -m "new commit message"
   - Usage: Modifies the most recent commit by changing its message or adding new changes to it (useful if you forgot to include a file in the previous commit).

10. git push
    - Usage: Uploads your local commits to a remote repository, typically GitHub or GitLab.

11. git push --set-upstream origin branch_name
    - Usage: Pushes the branch to the remote repository and sets the default remote tracking branch, allowing future pushes without specifying the remote branch.

12. git branch -l
    - Usage: Lists all local branches in your repository.

13. git branch -d branch_name
    - Usage: Deletes the specified branch. The branch must not be checked out, and it must have been fully merged.

14. git checkout branch_name
    - Usage: Switches to the specified branch in the repository.

15. git log
    - Usage: Shows the commit history for the current branch, displaying the commit hash, author, date, and message.

16. git switch branch_name
    - Usage: An alternative to git checkout, used for switching branches. This command is simpler and more intuitive.

17. git config --help
    - Usage: Displays help documentation for Git configuration commands.

18. git config --global user.name "name"
    - Usage: Sets the global username for commits. This will be used for all repositories unless overridden in a specific repository.

    - Usage: Sets the global email for commits. This will be used for all repositories unless overridden in a specific repository.

20. git restore --staged file_name
    - Usage: Removes a file from the staging area without modifying the working directory. Essentially "unstages" the file.

21. git fetch

22. git pull
    - Usage: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch in one step.

23. git merge --squash branch_name
    - Usage: Merges the specified branch into the current branch, but instead of creating multiple commits, it squashes all changes into a single commit.

24. history
    - Usage: Displays the history of commands entered in the terminal, useful for recalling previously run commands.
