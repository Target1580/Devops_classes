## Introduction to Linux

### What is Linux?

Linux is an Open Source Operating System modeled on Unix and developed in the C language.

### What is Open Source?

1. **Definition**: A software becomes open source if its source code is freely available.
2. **Historical Context**: 
   - The free software movement began in 1983 and gained momentum in 1998.
   - The term "Open Source" was coined to make the concept less ambiguous, and it became widely adopted.
3. **Collaboration**:
   - Open source projects are generally a collaborative effort by multiple developers.
   - These projects aim to enhance the product and allow others to benefit from it.
4. **Restrictions and Licensing**:
   - The owner may put restrictions on usage, modification, and distribution through various licenses.
   - However, the source code should still be available for everyone to study.

### Components of a linux OS

1. **Init Program**:  
   - The first program that initializes the system.  
   - Examples: `sysvinit`, `systemd`.

2. **Bootloader**:  
   - Loads the operating system when the system is powered on.  
   - Examples: `GNU Grub`, `Syslinux`.

3. **Software Libraries**:  
   - A collection of code used to develop and design software programs.

4. **Package Management System**:  
   - Tools for managing software installation, configuration, and upgrades.  
   - Examples: `dpkg`, `RPM`.

5. **Other Interfaces and Applications**:  
   - Applications and interfaces for various user tasks.

| **Cost**        | Free                                                | Not Free (varies by vendor)                                              |
| **Flexibility** | Yes                                                 | Not Flexible (requires specific hardware)                                |
| **Source Code** | Available                                           | Not Available (not a freeware)                                          |
| **Installation**| Economical                                          | Uneconomical (requires specific hardware)                               |
| **Community**   | Wide network of developers                          | Limited to commercial developers                                        |
| **Support**     | Forums and community-based support                  | Vendors provide technical support for commercial Unix                   |
| **Bug Fixes**   | Faster bug fixes                                    | Slower bug fixes compared to Linux                                      |

### kernel

- The **kernel** acts as the interface between applications and the hardware.
- Tasks performed by the kernel include:
  1. **Resource Allocation:** Manages computer resources and ensures that programs can use these resources efficiently.
  2. **Security Management:** Provides security and protection from faults and malicious activities.
  3. **Process Management:** Facilitates application execution with hardware abstraction.
  4. **Device Management:** Maintains a list of devices and ensures proper driver communication.
  5. **Scheduling:** Allocates CPU time to programs and switches between processes.
  6. **Memory Management:** Ensures processes access memory securely and as needed.

### Shell

- The **shell** is the interface that takes user commands and sends them to the kernel.
- Characteristics and functions of the shell:
  1. **Scripting:** Shells have their own programming language, allowing multiple commands to be combined into a single script.
  2. **Command Translation:** Converts commands from a human-readable format into binary for the kernel.
  3. **User Interaction:** Users interact with the operating system through the shell, though direct hardware interaction is also possible.
  4. **Historical Context:** The first shell, `sh`, was developed for Unix systems. While Linux still supports `sh`, `bash` is the more popular shell among Linux users.

### what is Linux Distribution(Distro)?
- A **Linux distribution (distro)** is an operating system built around the Linux kernel and includes GNU tools and additional applications.
- Examples of popular Linux distributions:
  1. **Ubuntu**
  2. **Debian**
  3. **RedHat Linux**
  4. **Fedora**
- Key characteristics:
  - There are over **600 Linux distributions** available, tailored to specific development groups, requirements, or customization needs.
  - Distributions can be community-supported or commercially supported.
  - Popular distros include Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, Debian, CentOS, and more.

---

### How to choose Distro?
- It is based on user requirements.
- Key factors to consider:
  - **Purpose of Use**: Whether it is for personal or professional purposes.
  - **Ease of Installation**: Whether configurations are done with default values or require manual choices.
  - **Look and Feel**: Preference for a graphical interface or command-line interface.
