3. Click on the **"Pull requests" tab** at the top of the page.
4. Click **"New pull request"**.
5. **Select the base and compare branches** (base branch is where the changes will go, compare branch is the one you're merging).
6. Add a **title** and **description** for your pull request and click **"Create pull request"**.

##### **Merging a Pull Request**
1. Once the pull request is created, the **Merge button** (usually green) will be enabled.
2. Review the changes and conflicts, if any.
3. If everything is fine, click **"Merge pull request"**.
4. **Confirm the merge** by clicking on **"Confirm merge"**.
5. Optionally, **delete the branch** after merging to keep the repository clean.
