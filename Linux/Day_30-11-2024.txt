>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> top Command  in linux <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The top command output is divided into several sections, each with specific information about system performance and processes. 
This section provides a breakdown of the output based on the information it shows.


>>>Header Information

    This Section shows basic system stats like uptime, active users, and recent system load:

    - up. Displays the System running time since the last reboot.
    -user(s).Shows the current number of active users.

    -load average. Lists the average system load over the last 1,5, and 15 minutes. Lower values indicate less CPU demand.

>>>Tasks
  The Tasks section provides a quick overview of all running processes and their states:

  - total = Indicates the number of processes currently running on the system.
  - running = Number of processes actively using CPU resources.
  - sleeping = Processes waiting for an event to continue (e.g., input/output).
  - stopped = Processes that are paused or waiting for signals.
  - zombie = Processes that have finished execution but remain in the process table.

>>>CPU Usage

  This section shows how various processes are using the CPU.

  -us = Time the CPU spends on user (non-kernel) processes.
  -sy = Time spent on system/Kernel processes.
  -ni = Time spent on user processes with adjusted priority(nice Values).
  -id = Percentage of time the cpu is idle.
  -wa = Time spent waiting for I/O operations (like disk access).
  -hi = Time handling hardware interrupts.
  -si = Time handling software interrupts.
  -st = Time "stolen" from the virtual machine by the hypervisor (when using virtualization).

>>>Memory Usage (Mem)
  memory usage stats explain how the system uses physical RAM.

  - total = Total physical available.
  - free = Unused RAM memory.
  - used = Total memory in use by the system.
  - buff/cashe = Memory reserved for buffers and caches. This memory can be reclaimed if needed by other processes.

>>>Swap Usage (Swap)
  The Swap section shows the disk-based memory usage, which the system uses when RAM is full.

  - total = Total swap memory (disk-based memory used when RAM is full).
  - free = Unused swap memory.
  - used = Swap currently in use.
  - avail Mem = Total memory available (sum of free and buffered memory)

>>>Process List
    The Process List displays detailed information about each active process.

    -  PID = The process ID.
    -  USER = The user account that started the process.
    -  PR = Process priority.
    -  NI = Nice value, affecting scheduling priority.
    -  VIRT = Total virtual memory the process uses.
    -  RES = Resident memory (actual physical memory in use).
    -  SHR = Shared memory used by the process.
    -  S = Process state (e.g., S for sleeping, R for running).
    -  %CPU = Percentage of CPU time used by the process.
    -  %MEM = Percentage of RAM used by the process.
    -  TIME+ = Total CPU time the process has consumed.
    -  COMMAND = The program, service, or command responsible for each active process.

>>>File Management

  =============================================
  mv:
   Move a file or directory.
    Example: mv file1 /destination/
   Rename a file or directory.
    Example: mv oldname newname
  ===========================================
  rm: Remove files.
    Example: rm file1
  ===========================================
  rmdir: Remove empty directories.
    Example: rmdir dir1
  ===========================================
  cp: Copy files or directories.
    Example: cp file1 /destination/
  ===========================================


>>>Hardware Information
  ============================================
  lshw: Displays detailed hardware information.
    Example: sudo lshw

  ============================================
  lscpu: Shows CPU architecture details.
    Example: lscpu
  ============================================
  lsblk: Lists information about block devices (disks).
    Example: lsblk
  =============================================





>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Questions <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
1. nic and renice:
   - nice: Starts a process with a specified priority (nice value).
   - renice: Changes the priority of an already running process.

2. Inode: A data structure storing metadata about a file (permissions, size, location on disk).

3. Swap: Disk space used when RAM is full to prevent crashes, though slower than RAM.
